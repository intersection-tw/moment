<LyricSection>

We&rsquo;re no strangers to love

You know the rules and so do I

A full commitment is what I&rsquo;m thinking of

You wouldn&rsquo;t get this from any other guy

I just wanna tell you how I&rsquo;m feeling

Gotta make you understand

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down

Never gonna run around and desert you

Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye

Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

We&rsquo;ve known each other for so long

Your heart has been aching but you&rsquo;re too shy to say it

Inside we both know what&rsquo;s been going on

We know the game and we&rsquo;re gonna play it

And if you ask me how I&rsquo;m feeling

Don&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;re too blind to see

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down

Never gonna run around and desert you

Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye

Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down

Never gonna run around and desert you

Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye

Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Woo, give you up...

Woo, never gonna give, never gonna give (give you up)...
