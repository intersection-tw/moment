Back in black 

I hit the sack

I've been too long I'm glad to be back

Yes I am

Let loose from the noose

That's kept me hanging about

I kept looking at the sky cause it's getting me high

Forget the hearse cause I'll never die

I got nine lives cat's eyes

Abusing every one of them and running wild

Cause I'm back

Yes I'm back

Well I'm back

Yes I'm back

Well I'm back back

Well I'm back in black

Yes I'm back in black

Back in the back of a Cadillac

Number one with a bullet I'm a power pack

Yes I am

In a bang with the gang

They've got to catch me if they want me to hang

Cause I'm back on the track and I'm beating the flack

Nobody's gonna get me on another rap

So look at me now I'm just making my play

Don't try to push your luck just get out of my way

Cause I'm back

Yes I'm back

Well I'm back

Yes I'm back

Well I'm back back

Well I'm back in black

Yes I'm back in black

Yes I'm back in black

Oh yeah, oh yeah

Yes I am

Oh yeah, yeah oh yeah

Back in now

Well I'm back, I'm back

Back, I'm back

Back, I'm back

Back, I'm back

Back, I'm back

Back

Back in black

Yes I'm back in black
