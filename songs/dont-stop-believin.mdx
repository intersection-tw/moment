<Section>

Just a small town girl

Livin&rsquo; in a lonely world

She took the midnight train goin&rsquo; anywhere

</Section>


<Section>

Just a city boy

Born and raised in south Detroit

He took the midnight train goin&rsquo; anywhere

</Section>

<Section>

A singer in a smoky room

A smell of wine and cheap perfume

For a smile they can share the night

It goes on and on, and on, and on

</Section>

<Section>

Strangers waiting

Up and down the boulevard

Their shadows searching in the night

</Section>

<Section>

Streetlights, people

Living just to find emotion

Hiding somewhere in the night

</Section>

<Section>

Working hard to get my fill

Everybody wants a thrill

Payin&rsquo; anything to roll the dice

Just one more time

</Section>

<Section>

Some will win, some will lose

Some were born to sing the blues

Oh, the movie never ends

It goes on and on, and on, and on

</Section>

<Section>

Strangers waitin&rsquo;

Up and down the boulevard

Their shadows searchin&rsquo; in the night

Streetlight people

Livin&rsquo; just to find emotion

Hidin&rsquo; somewhere in the night

</Section>

<Section>

Don&rsquo;t stop believin&rsquo;

Hold on to that feeling

Streetlight people

Don&rsquo;t stop believin&rsquo;

Hold on

Streetlight people

Don&rsquo;t stop believin&rsquo;

Hold on to that feeling

Streetlight people
