Sweet dreams are made of this

Who am I to disagree?

I travel the world and the seven seas

Everybody is looking for something

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Some of them want to use you

Some of them want to get used by you

Some of them want to abuse you

Some of them want to be abused

Hold your head up, keep your head up, moving on

Hold your head up, moving on, keep your head up, moving on

Hold your head up, moving on, keep your head up, moving on

Hold your head up, moving on, keep your head up
