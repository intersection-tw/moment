I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord

And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord

Can you feel it coming in the air tonight?

Oh lord, oh lord

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Well, if you told me you were drowning, I would not lend a hand

I've seen your face before, my friend, but I don't know if you know who I am

Well, I was there and I saw what you did, I saw it with my own two eyes

So you can wipe off that grin, I know where you've been

It's all been a pack of lies

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord

I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord

I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord

I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord, oh lord

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

I remember, I remember, don't worry, how could I ever forget?

It's the first time, the last time we ever met

But I know the reason why you keep your silence up, no, you don't fool me

The hurt doesn't show, but the pain still grows

It's no stranger to you and me

I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord

I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord

I can feel it in the air tonight, oh lord, oh lord

I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord

I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord

And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord

I can feel it in the air tonight, oh lord, oh lord, oh lord

I've been waiting for this moment all my life, oh lord, oh lord

I can feel it in the air tonight, oh lord, oh lord, oh lord, oh lord

I've been waiting for this moment all my life, oh lord, oh lord
