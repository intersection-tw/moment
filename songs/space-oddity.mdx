Ground Control to Major Tom

Ground Control to Major Tom

Take your protein pills

and put your helmet on

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Ground Control to Major Tom

Commencing countdown,

engines on

Check ignition

and may God's love be with you

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven, Six, Five, Four, Three, Two, One, Liftoff

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

This is Ground Control to Major Tom

You've really made the grade

And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear

Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

This is Major Tom to Ground Control

I'm stepping through the door

And I'm floating

in a most peculiar way

And the stars look very different today

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

For here

Am I sitting in a tin can

Far above the world

Planet Earth is blue

And there's nothing I can do

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles

I'm feeling very still

And I think my spaceship knows which way to go

Tell my wife I love her very much

She knows

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Ground Control to Major Tom

Your circuit's dead,

there's something wrong

Can you hear me, Major Tom?

Can you hear me, Major Tom?

Can you hear me, Major Tom?

Can you....

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Here am I floating round my tin can

Far above the Moon

Planet Earth is blue

And there's nothing I can do.
