<LyricSection>

Welcome to your life

There&rsquo;s no turning back

Even while we sleep

We will find you acting on your best behaviour

Turn your back on mother nature

Everybody wants to rule the world

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

It&rsquo;s my own design

It&rsquo;s my own remorse

Help me to decide

Help me make the most of freedom and of pleasure

Nothing ever lasts forever

Everybody wants to rule the world

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

There&rsquo;s a room where the light won&rsquo;t find you

Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down

When they do I&rsquo;ll be right behind you

So glad we&rsquo;ve almost made it

So sad they had to fade it

Everybody wants to rule the world

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

I can&rsquo;t stand this indecision

Married with a lack of vision

Everybody wants to rule the world

Say that you&rsquo;ll never never never never need it

One headline why believe it?

Everybody wants to rule the world

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

All for freedom and for pleasure

Nothing ever lasts forever

Everybody wants to rule the world
