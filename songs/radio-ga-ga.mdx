<LyricSection>

I would sit alone and watch your light

My only friend through teenage nights

Everything I had to know

I heard it on my radio

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

You gave them all those old-time stars

Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars

You made them laugh, you made them cry

You made us feel like we could fly

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Radio

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

So don&rsquo;t become some background noise

A backdrop for the girls and boys

Who just don&rsquo;t know or just don&rsquo;t care

And just complain when you&rsquo;re not there

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

You had your time, you had the power

You&rsquo;ve yet to have your finest hour

Radio, radio

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

All we hear is "Radio ga ga"

"Radio goo goo"

"Radio ga ga"

All we hear is "Radio ga ga"

"Radio blah blah"

Radio, what&rsquo;s new?

Radio, someone still loves you

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

We watch the shows, we watch the stars

On videos for hours and hours

We hardly need to use our ears

How music changes through the years

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Let&rsquo;s hope you never leave, old friend

Like all good things on you we depend

So, stick around because we might miss you

When we grow tired of all this visual

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

You had your time, you had the power

You have yet to have your finest hour

Radio, radio

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

All we hear is "Radio ga ga"

"Radio goo goo"

"Radio ga ga"

All we hear is "Radio ga ga"

"Radio goo goo"

"Radio ga ga"

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

All we hear is "Radio ga ga"

"Radio blah blah"

Radio, what&rsquo;s new?

Someone still loves you

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Radio ga ga

Radio ga ga

Radio ga ga

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

You had your time, you had the power

You have yet to have your finest hour

Radio, radio
