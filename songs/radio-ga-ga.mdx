<LyricSection>

I'd sit alone and watch your light

My only friend through teenage nights

And everything I had to know

I heard it on my radio

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

You gave them all those old-time stars

Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars

You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry

You made us feel like we could fly

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Radio

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

So, don't become some background noise

A backdrop for the girls and boys

Who just don't know or just don't care

And just complain when you're not there

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

You had your time, you had the power

You've yet to have your finest hour

Radio, radio

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

All we hear is "Radio ga ga

Radio goo goo

Radio ga ga

All we hear is "Radio ga ga

"Radio blah blah"

Radio, what's new?

Radio, someone still loves you

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

We watch the shows, we watch the stars

On videos for hours and hours

We hardly need to use our ears

How music changes through the years

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Let's hope you never leave, old friend

Like all good things on you we depend

So, stick around 'cause we might miss you

When we grow tired of all this visual

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

You had your time, you had the power

You've yet to have your finest hour

Radio, radio

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

All we hear is "Radio ga ga

Radio goo goo

Radio ga ga

All we hear is "Radio ga ga

Radio goo goo

Radio ga ga

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

All we hear is "Radio ga ga

Radio blah blah"

Radio, what's new?

Someone still loves you

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Radio ga ga

Radio ga ga

Radio ga ga

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

You had your time, you had the power

You've yet to have your finest hour

Radio, radio
