We don&rsquo;t need no education

We don&rsquo;t need no thought control

No dark sarcasm in the classroom

Teacher, leave the kids alone

Hey, teacher, leave the kids alone

All in all, it&rsquo;s just another brick in the wall

All in all, you are just another brick in the wall

We don&rsquo;t need no education

We don&rsquo;t need no thought control

No dark sarcasm in the classroom

Teachers, leave them kids alone

Hey, teacher, leave us kids alone

All in all, you are just another brick in the wall

All in all, you are just another brick in the wall

Wrong! Do it again!

Wrong! Do it again!

If you don&rsquo;t eat your meat, you can&rsquo;t have any pudding!

How can you have any pudding if you don&rsquo;t eat your meat?!

You! Yes, you, behind the bike sheds, stand still, laddy!
