<LyricSection>

Children behave

That&rsquo;s what they say when we&rsquo;re together

And watch how you play

They don&rsquo;t understand

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

And so we&rsquo;re running just as fast as we can

Holding on to one another&rsquo;s hand

Trying to get away into the night

And then you put your arms around me

And we tumble to the ground

And then you say

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

I think we&rsquo;re alone now

There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be anyone around

I think we&rsquo;re alone now

The beating of our hearts is the only sound

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Look at the way

We gotta hide what we&rsquo;re doing

&rsquo;Cause what would they say

If they ever knew?

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

And so we&rsquo;re running just as fast as we can

Holding on to one another&rsquo;s hand

Trying to get away into the night

And then you put your arms around me

And we tumble to the ground

And then you say

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

I think we&rsquo;re alone now (alone now)

There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be anyone around

I think we&rsquo;re alone now (alone now)

The beating of our hearts is the only sound

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

I think we&rsquo;re alone now (alone now)

There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be anyone around

I think we&rsquo;re alone now

The beating of our hearts is the only sound

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Running just as fast as we can

Holding on to one another&rsquo;s hand

Trying to get away into the night

And then you put your arms around me

And we tumble to the ground

And then you say

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

I think we&rsquo;re alone now

There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be anyone around

I think we&rsquo;re alone now

The beating of our hearts is the only sound

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

I think we&rsquo;re alone now (alone now)

There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be anyone around

I think we&rsquo;re alone now

The beating of our hearts is the only sound

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

I think we&rsquo;re alone now (alone now)
