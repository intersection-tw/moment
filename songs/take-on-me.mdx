<LyricSection>

We&rsquo;re talking away

I don&rsquo;t know what

I&rsquo;m to say I&rsquo;ll say it anyway

Today&rsquo;s another day to find you

Shying away

I&rsquo;ll be coming for your love, okay?

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Take on me (take on me)

Take me on (take on me)

I&rsquo;ll be gone

In a day or two

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

So needless to say

I&rsquo;m odds and ends

But I&rsquo;ll be stumbling away

Slowly learning that life is okay

Say after me

It&rsquo;s no better to be safe than sorry

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Take on me (take on me)

Take me on (take on me)

I&rsquo;ll be gone

In a day or two
