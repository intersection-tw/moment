<LyricSection>

We are talking away

I don&rsquo;t know what

I&rsquo;m to say I will say it anyway

Today is another day to find you

Shying away

I will be coming for your love, okay?

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Take on me (take on me)

Take me on (take on me)

I will be gone

In a day or two

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

So needless to say

I am odds and ends

But I will be stumbling away

Slowly learning that life is okay

Say after me

It&rsquo;s no better to be safe than sorry

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Take on me (take on me)

Take me on (take on me)

I will be gone

In a day or two
